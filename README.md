### **🟥🔵 Red vs Blue - The Battle for Conquest 🔵🟥**  
_A strategic cellular automaton game where **Red** and **Blue** fight to dominate the grid._

---

### **📜 Game Rules**
1. **🟥 🔵 Initial Setup:**  
   - The grid is **50x50** with **25% Red, 25% Blue, and 50% White (neutral spaces).**  
   - Red and Blue cells are randomly distributed.  

2. **⚔️ Battle Rules:**  
   - **A Red cell (🟥) can turn Blue (🔵)** if **at least one Blue neighbor exists**, with a probability based on the number of Blue neighbors.  
   - **A Blue cell (🔵) can turn Red (🟥)** if **at least one Red neighbor exists**, with a probability based on the number of Red neighbors.  
   - **More neighbors = higher chance of conversion.**  

3. **🏰 Conquest Rules:**  
   - White (⬜) cells can be **"conquered"** by Red or Blue if **at least 4 neighboring cells of the same color** surround them.  
   - Once a White cell is conquered, it permanently changes to that color.  

4. **🏁 Winning Condition:**  
   - The game **runs until an equilibrium is reached** (no further meaningful changes).  
   - At equilibrium, **the side with the most cells wins**!  
   - If Red has more cells → 🏆 **Red Wins!**  
   - If Blue has more cells → 🏆 **Blue Wins!**  
   - If both sides are equal → 🤝 **It’s a tie!**  

5. **🔄 Play Again Button:**  
   - After a game ends, click **"Play Again"** to restart with a **new random battle.**

### **🔥 Game Dynamics & Strategy**
- The **battle is unpredictable**, and territories shift dynamically.  
- **Neutral white spaces act as battlegrounds**, making **expansion a key factor**.  
- Games often end when **one color dominates or both reach an equilibrium.**
